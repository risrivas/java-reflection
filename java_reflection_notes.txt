- Reflection API was introduced in Java 1
- Method handles was introduced in Java 7
- read and modfy the content of an object at runtime without knowing its class or structure
- how to discover the content of an object at runtime
- Method handles were included to enhance the performance

- Several classes: Class, Field, Method, Constructor, Annotation

########
# Class
########
- cannot "create" a class instance

- get reference by:
1) can query an object for its class

- example
String hello = "Hello";
Class helloClass = hello.getClass();

- only one instance of Class for a given class
- getClass() method is available in Object class
Class<?> getClass();

Class<?> helloClass = hello.getClass(); // OK
Class<String> helloClass = hello.getClass(); // Compiler Error
Class<Object> helloClass = hello.getClass(); // Compiler Error

make it work:
Class<? extends String> helloClass = hello.getClass(); // OK
Class<? extends Object> helloClass = hello.getClass(); // OK

2) get a class by its name, known at compile time or runtime
